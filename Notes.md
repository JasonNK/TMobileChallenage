• Implemented the basic requirements

• I applied MVVM for this application development.

• Implemented infinite scrolling in the user table view.

• I used SDWebImage to handle the image cache.

• I used activity indicator whenever the user is searching for data.

• Initialy the list on the home screen is empty and user is expected to type in search strings in order to show the github users.

• The deployment target of this applicaion is iOS 13 and above so it needs XCode 11 to run.
